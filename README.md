# ETHernals-Submission

Report Card provides snapshot of task list, completed tasks and completion points earned 
With the ToDoList.sol as base, I have incorporated the following refinements:
(i) struct includes additional property points : each task is identified by specific points
(ii) there is a new function to calculate the total points earned from completed task
(iii) all these are updated in the front end to better reflect the additional functionality
